# 🎮 PhaserJS in ReactJS – [Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuvV2oAgdRixSW6g-F3G2rCEZXCy2ZGlo)

Welcome to this repository! This is the official source code repository for my PhaserJS in ReactJS tutorial series on YouTube. 🚀

## 📌 About This Series
In this series, I aim to establish a strong foundation for using PhaserJS with ReactJS. Through hands-on tutorials, you'll learn how to create small games that will help you develop essential Phaser skills, ultimately enabling you to build more complex projects.

Along the way, I’ll also introduce best practices and coding norms to help maintain a clean and scalable codebase.

By the end of this series, you’ll have a complete end-to-end project to showcase in your portfolio.

## 🔍 Finding the Right Branch
To make it easy for you to follow along with the tutorial series, I have organized the source code into separate branches, each corresponding to a specific video. This allows you to access the exact code for any stage of the project.

### 📌 How the Branches Are Structured
- The main branch contains the latest and most up-to-date version of the project, reflecting the final version covered in the tutorials.
- Each video has its own branch named according to its episode number. For example:
    - `01-phaser-setup-in-react` – Code from the first video (setting up the project)
    - `02-directory-structure` – Code from the second video (adding sprites)
    - … and so on.
This structure allows you to jump to any stage of the tutorial and see how the code evolved over time.
